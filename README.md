# RoboticVacuum
An original design for a Bluetooth controlled vacuum.

The robotic vacuum is made up of two motors and the vacuum itself.
To change directions one motor will spin one way while the other motor spins the other way.
Vacuum on/off, and direction and speed of the motors can be controlled wirelessly through an application called Ardroid (developed by Anurag Goel).
Works with Android devices.
